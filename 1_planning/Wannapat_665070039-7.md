## Experimental design <a name="expdesign"></a>
The datasets used in this hands-on CliNaP-M short course (April 2022) is part of the project, namely, "Investigation of satisfaction-related molecular components in fermented fish seasoning (Pla-Ra)for improving industrial production" funded by Thailand Science Research and Innovation to Dr. Jutarop Phetchraburanin who is the legal owner of all datasets. Hence, all datasets provided in this short course should be stricly used for academic training purposes by KKUIPL only - all rights reserved. 

This sub-experiment aimed to investigate the metabolic differences in fermented fish with different fermentation times including baseline (day 0), week 2 and week 6 and different conditions: raw and cooked samples. All fermented fish samples were extracted using dual-phase extraction (methanol:chloroform:water, 1:3:1 [v/v/v]). Aqueous extracts were analysed using NMR and LC-MS to explore the alterations in nutritional, functional and toxic metabolite pools at different fermentation times and conditions. In addition, odour satisfaction was assessed by food experts and data were recorded. Metabolome data can then be integrated with odour satisfaction using chemometrics in order to investigate odour satisfaction-related metabolites. The outcomes of this experiment can provide novel nutritional information to consumers and also aid the fermented fish manufacturer to formulate their products that suit the consumer demands.

## Group work <a name="groupwork"></a>
Groups 1 - 3 are provided with NMR dataset while groups 4 - 6 obtain LC-MS dataset. Odour satisfaction score is given to all groups for correlation analysis.

Here are the tasks to be addressed at the end of short course for each group:
- Group 1: How do the NMR metabolite profiles of fermented fish differ at different fermentation time points of each condition?

1. Early Fermentation: In the initial stages of fermentation, there may be an increase in amino acids due to protein breakdown by enzymes produced by microorganisms. This can lead to the formation of various nitrogen-containing compounds, such as amines and ammonia. Additionally, organic acids like lactic acid may start to accumulate due to the metabolic activity of lactic acid bacteria.
2. Mid-Fermentation: As the fermentation progresses, the activity of microorganisms can lead to further degradation of proteins and lipids. This can result in the production of additional amino acids, fatty acids, and their derivatives. The levels of organic acids may also continue to increase.
3. Late Fermentation: Towards the end of fermentation, the metabolite profile may exhibit a shift due to the depletion of available nutrients and changes in microbial communities. The levels of some metabolites, such as amino acids and organic acids, may start to decrease as they are consumed by microorganisms. At the same time, the production of other compounds, such as alcohols, esters, and volatile compounds, may increase, contributing to the unique flavors and aromas associated with fermented fish.

- Group 2: How do the NMR metabolite profiles of raw fermented fish differ from those of the cooked ones at each fermentation time point?

1. Raw Fermented Fish
- Higher levels of amino acids: Raw fermented fish typically contains higher levels of amino acids compared to cooked fermented fish. This is because cooking can lead to the denaturation and breakdown of proteins, resulting in the degradation of amino acids.
- Presence of enzymes: Raw fermented fish may still contain active enzymes, which can continue to metabolize and transform compounds during fermentation. These enzymes can contribute to the breakdown of proteins and the production of various metabolites.
2. Cooked Fermented Fish
- Changes in protein structure: Cooking fermented fish can cause structural changes in proteins, leading to the denaturation and aggregation of proteins. This can affect the availability of protein substrates for microbial metabolism during fermentation.
- Altered microbial activity: Cooking can also affect the microbial populations involved in the fermentation process. The heat can kill or inhibit certain microorganisms, leading to changes in the metabolic activities and metabolite production. This can result in differences in the metabolite profiles compared to raw fermentation.
- Volatile compound formation: Cooking can generate volatile compounds through various chemical reactions and Maillard reactions, contributing to the aroma and flavor of the cooked fermented fish. These volatile compounds may not be present or at lower levels in raw fermented fish.

- Group 3: Investigate the relationship between NMR metabolome and odour satisfaction?

1. Sample Selection: Choose a set of samples that represent different odors or odor profiles. These samples can include food products, beverages, or other aromatic substances. Ensure that the samples cover a range of odor intensities or qualities.
2. NMR Metabolomics Analysis: Perform NMR metabolomics analysis on the selected samples. This involves preparing the samples, acquiring NMR spectra, and processing the data. The NMR spectra will provide information about the metabolite composition of the samples.
3. Odor Evaluation: Conduct sensory evaluation tests to assess odor satisfaction. This can involve using trained sensory panels or consumer panels. The participants evaluate the odor characteristics of the samples and rate their satisfaction levels using appropriate scales or questionnaires.
4. Statistical Analysis: Analyze the NMR metabolomics data and the odor satisfaction ratings to identify any correlations or relationships. This can be done using multivariate statistical methods such as principal component analysis (PCA) or partial least squares regression (PLSR). These analyses can help identify metabolites or metabolite patterns that are associated with odor satisfaction.
5. Identification of Key Metabolites: Identify the metabolites that show significant correlations with odor satisfaction. This can be done by comparing the NMR data with databases of known metabolites or performing targeted metabolite identification experiments such as 2D NMR or mass spectrometry.
6. Interpretation and Validation: Interpret the results and discuss the potential biochemical or sensory implications of the identified metabolites. Validate the findings by conducting additional experiments or sensory tests if necessary.

- Group 4: How do the LC-MS metabolite profiles of fermented fish differ at different fermentation time points of each condition?

1. Early Fermentation: In the initial stages of fermentation, there may be an increase in certain metabolites related to protein breakdown and microbial activity. This can include amino acids, peptides, and nitrogen-containing compounds. Additionally, organic acids such as lactic acid may start to accumulate due to the metabolic activity of lactic acid bacteria.
2. Mid-Fermentation: As the fermentation progresses, there may be further breakdown of proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates, leading to the production of additional metabolites. This can include a wider range of amino acids, fatty acids, and their derivatives. The levels of organic acids may continue to increase, and the presence of other compounds such as alcohols and esters may become more prominent.
3. Late Fermentation: Towards the end of fermentation, the metabolite profile may exhibit a shift due to the depletion of available nutrients and changes in microbial communities. The levels of some metabolites, such as amino acids and organic acids, may start to decrease as they are consumed by microorganisms. At the same time, the production of other compounds, such as alcohols, esters, and volatile compounds, may increase, contributing to the unique flavors and aromas associated with fermented fish.

This can affect the availability of protein substrates for microbial metabolism during fermentation and can result in changes in the metabolite profiles compared to raw fermentation.
- Altered microbial activity: Cooking can also affect the microbial populations involved in the fermentation process. The heat can kill or inhibit certain microorganisms, leading to changes in the metabolic activities and metabolite production. This can result in differences in the metabolite profiles compared to raw fermentation.
- Formation of Maillard reaction products: Cooking can generate Maillard reaction products through the reaction between amino acids and reducing sugars. These products can contribute to the flavor, aroma, and color of the cooked fermented fish and may not be present or at lower levels in raw fermented fish.
- Volatile compound formation: Cooking can also lead to the formation of volatile compounds through various chemical reactions. These volatile compounds can contribute to the aroma and flavor of the cooked fermented fish and may differ from the volatile compounds present in raw fermented fish.

6. Interpretation and Validation: Interpret the results and discuss the potential biochemical or sensory implications of the identified metabolites. Validate the findings by conducting additional experiments or sensory tests if necessary.

- Groups 1 & 4, 2 & 5 and 3 & 6: Compare and contrast your results between NMR and LC-MS/MS datasets.

NMR and LC-MS/MS provide different strengths and perspectives in metabolomics analysis. NMR spectroscopy offers a broad overview of the metabolome, detecting a wide range of metabolites, including small moleculeslike organic acids, amino acids, sugars, and lipids. It is advantageous for detecting abundant metabolites and can provide a general understanding of the metabolite changes associated with fermentation and cooking processes. On the other hand, LC-MS/MS is highly sensitive and can detect a broader range of metabolites, including low-abundance compounds and peptides. It provides a more comprehensive coverage of the metabolome and can offer detailed insights into the chemical diversity and complexity of the metabolite profiles.

Comparing the results between NMR and LC-MS/MS datasets allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the metabolite changes associated with different conditions and time points. While NMR can provide an initial overview of the metabolite composition and changes, LC-MS/MS can offer a more detailed analysis of specific metabolites or metabolic pathways. By combining the information from both techniques, a more holistic understanding of the metabolite profiles and their relationship with odor satisfaction can be achieved.

Additionally, the comparison between NMR and LC-MS/MS results can help identify the strengths and limitations of each technique. NMR provides valuable information on abundant metabolites and is particularly useful for studying changes in amino acids, sugars, and organic acids. LC-MS/MS, on the other hand, excels in detecting a broader range of metabolites, including low-abundance compounds and peptides. The two techniques can complement each other, providing a more comprehensive characterization of the metabolome and a deeper understanding of the chemical processes underlying odor satisfaction.

**Please note that if you are intereted in addressing the other tasks apart from your one, please feel free to do so. However, in your final group presentation, you need to present only your group task. Your extra results can be secretly kept for our class discussion :)**
